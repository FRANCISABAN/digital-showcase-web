```git
git add .          //for adding all modified files to the staging process
git add <filename> //or use this for a specific file to be added
```

Once, added to the staging process, you need to commit it with a message for proper procedures.
```git
git commit -m "added a file about my achievements on Dean's List" //Dean Lister yarn!?
```

git push //for ease or you can do it using ssh or hash codes for a more secure way
```
